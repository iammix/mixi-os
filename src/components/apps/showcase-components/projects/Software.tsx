                <p>
                mixiosk.com is my personal portfolio websiteâ€”and the one you're currently browsing.
                I built this platform to showcase my work in a way that's both interactive and reflective of my technical and creative abilities.
                The idea for the site came to me in early 2024, and I began development shortly after.
                Since then, it has evolved alongside my personal and professional growth, becoming a central hub for my projects, skills, and interests.

                By implementing sub-stepping techniques for both load and displacement control analyses, this package facilitates the handling of large and complex structural systems.
