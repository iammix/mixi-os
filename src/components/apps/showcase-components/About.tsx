                    I'm a software engineer with a strong passion for technology, solving real-life problems, and data-driven solutions.
                    I hold an Integrated Master's degree in Civil & Structural Engineering from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki (2018) and a Master's in Structural and Earthquake Engineering from the same institution (2019).

                    Over the years, I've bridged the gap between engineering and technology, developing custom software solutions, compuntational tools, data analysis tools, and digital applications tailored to the needs of the product owners. My expertise spans computational analysis, backend system designing, and software developmentâ€”fields where precision and innovation go hand in hand.

                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <br />
                <p>
                    My journey into software developing started with my fascination for problem-solving and technology. During my studies, I worked on several research projects involving computational analysis, numerical modeling, and real-time monitoring systems.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    As I delved deeper into these topics, I realized the power of coding in automating complex tasks, analyzing massive datasets, and improving decision-making processes in engineering. This led me to develop custom Python libraries.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                    I also have a keen interest in entrepreneurship and product development, with a focus on building scalable software solutions.
                </p>

                        <br />
                        <p>
                            When I am not working on engineering or software projects, you can find me rowing, training for triathlon, and experimenting with fitness tracking. I'm deeply interested in human performance, recovery metrics, and wearable technology, which has led me to develop an App for monitoring training load, HRV, and recovery.
                        </p>
                        <br />
                        <p>
                            I'm also passionate about drawing, music, cooking and traveling. These activities provide balance and inspiration, often influencing my approach to both problem-solving and creativity in tech.
